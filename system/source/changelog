	  half-constructed objects.
	  

18-02-2005

	. Lots of changes to the kernel in order to 
	  support multiple schedulers. Also, I did this
	  so that it would be easier to delete, finish
	  and crash processes and threads.

03-02-2005

	. Created an "auto" fs type so that the FileSystem
	  classes will test the device until a suitable
	  FileSystem is found. The first compatible match.
	. Modified the CDROM iso9660 FS driver so that it's
	  case insensitive.
	. Modified the init program to accept parameters.
	. Added the "root=[device]" parameter to the init
	  program so that the grub menu can specify the
	  root device. FS is "auto" by default.

	  Run() directly.  Now I'm assuming that the 
	  programmer knows what he/she's doing.
	. Fixed the floppy.conf file.


31-01-2005

	. Lots of changes to the consoles in the kernel
	  and the kernel libraries.
	. Modifications to the kernel make the consoles
	  dynamic.
	. The kernel now also keeps the active_pid value
	  in it's own console structure.
	. The libkernel now has a mode attached to the
	  console structures it uses. The modes are either
	  VC_MODE_MESSAGE or VC_MODE_BUFFER. Buffer is the
	  normal text mode whereas Message sends a Pulse
	  to the specified receipient.
	. This is the initial implementation. It will 
	  probably change to get better.

26-01-2005

	. Created a ScrollBar, Scrollable class and
	  improved the ListView to support them.

24-01-2005

	  all the memory up yet.
	. Added a new "thread_test" function to the shell.


04-01-2005

	. Fixed the DeviceNode stuff. 
	. VFS working again.
	. Shell sends command line parameters for the run command.
	. Successfully ran mpeg2decode from inside the system.


03-01-2005

	. Imported the MPEG2 player code from mpeg.org
	  into the apps/mpeg2decode directory. It compiles
	  successfully but needs the file IO and a few math
	  functions.
	. Beginning of the math.c implementation of the
	  libc library.
	. Modified init to wait for the server ports to open.

28-12-2004

	  file system.  The file system needs work.

15-11-2004

	. Made the VFS a little more tolerant. 
	. Added a List method to the FileSystem class
	  in the VFS.
	. Implemented the List method in the iso9660 fs
	  so now you can list the contents of a CD.

14-11-2004
	
	. Incorporated the ext2fs file system into the
	  VFS. It successfully detects and loads the
	  file system. However, I need to fix it. It doesn't
	  read the correct files.
	. Modified the ata driver to support partitions.
	  So now there are devices that look like this: 
	  /device/storage/hda0 and so on.

	. Damn stupid bug in the atapi driver which wouldn't
	  read anything more than 1 sector correctly. I wasted
	  HOURS on it.


06-11-2004

	. Cleaned up the ATA driver and implemented the nice 
	  read and write methods.
	. Created the ATAPI driver and it now successfully reads
	  CD's and it ejects. 


04-11-2004

	. A working ATA driver that needs to be cleaned up.

31-10-2004

	. Finished the Exchange class. It's pretty cool. I wonder
	  if I should integrate it into the Messenger class and
	  then there won't be any hassle with remember where
	  to send what and how to send it.
	. Complete a rudimentary File class. Read, Write, Open, Close
	  and Seek all work.
	. The VFS seems to work for device nodes.
 	. Converted the old IDE driver to the new class.
	. Made the File::Seek, VFS and DeviceNode operations use
	  64 signed bits for position.
	. Beginnings of an ATA driver.

	  allow to asynchronous communication with 
	  replies.
	  

29-10-2004

	. Created the VFS server and a DeviceNode class.

	. Created a View class. You can add them to Windows
	  now.


27-10-2004

	. Created a wm directory for the new window managers
	  and I've also created a new interface/WindowManager
	  class.
	. I've added hooks into the gui_server to inform
	  the WindowManager of any events.
	  

24-10-2004

	. lots & lots. The Window class and the new gui_server
	  are coming along nicely.

18-10-2004

	. The kernel library now initialises the constructors
	  list and runs the desctructor list.
	. Geez.. so much trouble but it's all working now.
	. Added a Driver class which is a descendent of
	  Application.

17-10-2004

	. A new direction with the renaming of the spoon
	  library to libbe and a whole new spoon library
	  to my own tastes.

03-10-2004

	. Acquisition of an IRQ now unmasks the IRQ 
	  if it was masked.


30-09-2004

	. Re-implemented the window section syncing.
	. Further implemented the String class in
	  spoon library. All operators work.
	. Cleaned up the openunix and posix libraries. 
	  I haven't implemented them properly
	  yet.

	  information.
	. Updated the floppy.conf and uploaded a new
	  floppy image.

	  windows, themes, etc. Themes are now handled by
	  the application itself.
	. Changes to the app_server to support the new
	  library changes.

18-09-2004

	. Further work on the cd player. I added a volume bar but
	  it doesn't work.
	. Update the floppy configuration.
	  

17-09-2004

	. The kernel now masks any unhandled IRQ's.
	. It also doesn't print out unhandled warnings
	  in lfb mode.
	. I also created the cd player application.

09-09-2004

	. Changed the idea of the consoles. Now there
	  are several kernel consoles with shared pages
	  between processes which are attached a single
	  console.
	. Added new system calls to reflect the changes.
	. Added new library calls to reflect the changes.
	. Modified init to move everything that isn't the
	  shell to console number 2.
	

03-09-2004

	. The new capability thingy is now in place. Access
	  to all the system calls can be granted/revoked at
	  will to remote or local threads. The system is 
	  thread-bound.


02-09-2004

	. kernel: process_id -> pid
	. kernel: thread_id -> tid
	. Lots of changes to prepare for the capabilities as well
	  as some cleaning up and documentation.


26-08-2004

	. I was messing around with the app_server and now it
	  has special effects and stuff. I wonder how long they
	  will last.
	. I increased the size of pulses from 4 pieces of 
	  information to 6 pieces of information.
	. Fixed that bug in the app_server which crashed it on
	  window closing. I was removing a pointer from a List
	  and the return value is a bool but I was using it
	  as the removed pointer. dah.
	. The kernel now prints output to the LFB buffer now
	  when it's in LFB mode.
	

25-08-2004

	. I kinda included a random number pool in the kernel. I
	  don't know how random it is.
	. I also implemented the atexit() and exit() functions of
	  C99 in libc.
	

23-08-2004

	. Improved the printf function in libc - more in
	  line the standard gcc printf.
	. Improved the conio_* functions in libkernel.
	. Created a sprintf function.
	. Quickly fixed the DeskBar to print the correct
	  time.


22-08-2004

	. I created a NetConfig class which allows the programmer
	  to manipulate the net_server configuration. Interface
	  and routing information can be changed.
	. Added some additional functions to the shell: route,
	  ifconfig, reboot, clear.
	. Update the floppy.conf

20-08-2004

	. I got the ARP replies working again. I was replying
	  with the ARP_Packet->Length() length which is 
	  incorrect. I will need to look at this and determine
	  what it should be.

19-08-2004

	. Modified the shell to contain a function 
	  directory with a function list.  The functions
	  themselves are implemented in their own "main"
	  functions.
	. net_server: ARP packets are spliced up into their
	  own queue and dealt with separately along with
	  being sent to the stack for userland sniffers.
	. net_server: ARP replies are generated manually now.
	. Packet.h classes now have a Create function
	  for each which causes the packet to become the owner.
	. Exception relocations are now also given kernel stacks to 
	  prevent further exceptions.
	. Note to self: be careful of inheritance in Packet.h
	. Packets to transmit are now queued and then transmitted
	  by a separate thread.


18-08-2004

	. Further work on the ARP daemon.
	. Kernel IRQ handling now breaks out of an IRQ
	  servicing request after a certain amount of
	  time.
	. All ARP traffic now goes straight to the
	  ARP daemon.
	. Incoming packets in the net_server are now
	  queued up for a separate thread to handle.


17-08-2004

	. Created a basic ARP daemon for the net_server. It
	  doesn't work yet.

16-08-2004

	. I'm creating a DJFS file system driver in order
	  to experiment with my new vfs_server design.
	. Created a RAMDisk driver. Two RAMDisks are created
	  by default.
	. Continued work on the net_server. I think I have
	  basic routing in place.

15-08-2004
	
	. Improved the networking code by adding 
	  the InterfaceManager and RouteManager.
	. Using everything I've learnt by doing the
	  net_server to rewrite the vfs_server.

12-08-2004

	. Improved the RawSocket class to include
	  proper return codes, correct messaging,
	  decent registration, etc. 
	. Improved the net_server to accomodate
	  processes/sockets/binds.
	. Implemented a transmission attempt.


08-08-2004

	. Created a spoon/network/RawSocket class which
	  can bind to sockets in the net_server. Data is
	  transferred using the new message system.
	. Modified tester1 to display ARP messages.
	. Modified tester2 to display UDP messages.
	. Created tester3 to display IP messages.
	. Created a sniffer app to display all packets
	  from the network.


07-08-2004

	. Modified the pulse and message calls to send directly
	  to threads now as opposed to a single process entry
	  point. This is done to speed up my socket code.


06-08-2004

	. Added messages into the kernel and the kernel library.
	. All "pulse_handler" functions and references have 
	  been changed to "ipc_handler".
	. Created two test programs for the new messaging.
	  tester1 and tester2
	. Added a changelog.
